Webhook is a way for apps to exchange information in real-time. When a specific event occurs, data is sent from JsonTrans to your designated Webhook URL automatically. 

## How to setup the Webhook in 3 Steps

Step 1: Go to Developer/Webhooks settings to configure Webhook settings.

Step 2: Click "Add endpoint".

Step 3: Enable the Webhook trigger to start receiving translated docs.

## Webhooks Retries

JsonTrans uses the POST method to enable event-driven automation and send translated docs in real-time. To ensure exceptional reliability and deliverability of shipping notifications, should JsonTrans fail to send you a Webhook message, up to 3 retries will be attempted within 1 hour.

Retries are implemented with exponential backoff. The formula is 2^(number of retries) x 30s. Here's JsonTrans's automatic retry schedule:

First retry after 30 seconds
Second retry after 60 seconds (1 minute)
Third retry after 120 seconds (2 minutes)
