## API Keys

- **Obtaining**: To access the API, you’ll need a valid API key. Retrieve it from your account settings. If unavailable, please contact support.
  
- **Authentication**: This API primarily authenticates using a custom header.

- **Usage**: Always include your `API key` in the request header as follows:

```json
"jt-api-key": "your_api_key_here"
```

## JSON Response

Expect responses from the API in JSON format. Ensure your system can handle this data structure. For errors, check the `error` key within the JSON response.

## Handling Authentication Errors

If your API key is absent, not formatted correctly, or invalid, you’ll receive a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP response.
